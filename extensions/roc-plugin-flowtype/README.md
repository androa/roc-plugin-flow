# roc-plugin-flow

Plugin providing FlowType type checking.

## Installation

`npm install roc-plugin-flow`

## Getting started

A `.flowconfig` file will be created in the root of your project if none exists. The following is the recommended minimum 
to work correctly with [roc-package-web-app-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/roc-package-web-app-react). If you have
 an existing `.flowconfig` file and it doesn't include these lines then you'll likely want to add them.

```ini
[ignore]
.*/node_modules/fbemitter/.*
.*/node_modules/fbjs/.*
.*/node_modules/flux/.*
.*/node_modules/yellowbox-react/.*
```

Add `// @flow` to the top of each file that you want to check and run the checker with `roc flow`.

You can find out more about FlowType and how to configure it on the [FlowType website](https://flowtype.org).
